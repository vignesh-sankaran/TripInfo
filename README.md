# TripInfo

An app to display train timetables for a specified station and direction.

## Architecture

The app uses the MVVM (Model View View-Model) architecture pattern.

## Roadmap

The first functional release of TripInfo (codenamed Mark 1) will allow a user to select a 
station in Melbourne, and a specific direction that they want to view a timetable for e.g. 
City-bound trains. 

The next release will support setting up journeys between stations. Subsequent releases
will introduce different transport modes e.g. trams.

A feature I would like to introduce in the future is the ability for users to notified 
about whether they will make the next train as they are making their way to the station.

The ultimate goal of this app is to cover as many use cases as possible with Melbourne's
public transport system . Public transport is a tough problem space to build apps for since
there is a myriad of modes and stops, and many different ways people may use what is available
to them.
